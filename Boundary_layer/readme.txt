This folder contains a single file describing the boundary layer above the roofs, measured by means of a Hot Wire Anemometer.
The data are in non-dimensional form.

$U_{inf}$ is the streamwise velocity at the top of the boundary layer ($z=\delta$).
$\sigma_U$, $\sigma_V$, $\sigma_W$ are the standard deviations of the velocity components along $X$, $Y$, $Z$
$u'w'$ and $u'v'$ are the products of the turbulent velocity fluctuations.
$\varepsilon$ and $P$ are the dissipation and production rate of turbulent kinetic energy.
