This folder provides the concentration measurements performed by means of a Flame Ionisation Detector inside the street canyon. 
The measurement grid covers the entire 3D volume of the canyon. 
The non-dimensional concentration is expressed as $\overline{C^*}=C U_\infty L_s \delta/Q_{et}$, where $C$ is the time-averaged concentration of ethane in each sampling point, $L_s$ is the source length and $Q_{et}$ is the flow rate of ethane. 
Three configurations with different tree density are investigated: Zero, Half and Full configurations.
